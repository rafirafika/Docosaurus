Something has been done
* choose free hosting server - Github Page I'M WITH U  ^_^
* make project on github - this is my tutorial I used [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) 
* setting siteConfig and build project
* commit and push all build result to github project (refer to step 2 above)
* When it's finished, this project can be accessed through [https://rafirafika.github.io/Docosaurus/](https://rafirafika.github.io/Docosaurus/)

I'm trying to use all feature that docosaurus has, so let's try to add facebook social button on our blog.
* First, we need to have facebookAppId, please follow this tutorial [how-to-generate-facebook-app-id](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-generate-facebook-app-id/)
* Set up siteConfig, put facebookAppId and set facebookComments as true,
* Build change and push to github project


Btw why is this blog be like a tutorial huh? when from the beginning I just wanted to confide in,
